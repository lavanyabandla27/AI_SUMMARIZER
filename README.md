📘 ScholarLens – AI Research Insight Engine

ScholarLens is a web-based application designed to help students and researchers quickly understand academic research papers by generating concise summaries from uploaded PDF documents using AI-driven analysis.

🔍 Project Overview

Reading long research papers can be time-consuming and overwhelming. ScholarLens simplifies this process by allowing users to upload academic PDF files and receive a clear, short, and meaningful summary that captures the core ideas of the paper.

This project currently focuses on a frontend prototype with a complete workflow, while being fully prepared for AI backend integration in future versions.

🚀 Features

📄 Upload academic research papers in PDF format

🧠 AI-based research paper summarization (backend ready)

⚡ Fast, simple, and distraction-free user interface

🎓 Designed for students, researchers, and beginners

🔌 Easy integration with AI APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

⚙️ How It Works

User selects a research paper in PDF format

The document is uploaded through the interface

Content is processed for analysis

AI engine (to be integrated) generates a concise summary

Summary is displayed on the screen

Current version demonstrates the complete UI flow.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
